        <h1>Backender's Spellbook : my response to your request</h1>
<p>How should the backend respond to a request?</p>
<p>This question has no objectively right answer. It really depends on the situation. But I'm going to
try to pitch my philosophy in <strong>give them everything</strong> and <strong>maintain structure</strong>.</p>
<p>caveat : if you have sensitive information, then of course redact that information; this data should never be given to the client to begin with.</p>
<h2>Example : Pet Shelter</h2>
<p>In this fictitious example, I work as a volunteer software developer at an dog animal shelter. I need to
keep track of every dog that comes into the shelter for legal and bookkeeping purposes. We have a
website that shows the names and pictures of our pets.</p>
<p>On the backend, we collect a lot of information about each pet. This includes :</p>
<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>breed</li>
<li>location-found</li>
<li>start-date</li>
<li>leave-date</li>
<li>isAdopted</li>
<li>s3ImageId
(this could go on for quite a while ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the website needs to render a picture of the pet along with their name.</p>
<p>In an attempt to <strong>give them everything</strong>, the UI will fetch all the pets in the database (footnote 1), and
the backend will respond with a list of pets. This list of pets will include ALL the information for each pet in the database.
My point is that I don't need or want to conform to the requirements of the frontend;
even though the name and picture are the only requirements, I still give them info about the location-found, start-date, etc...
It is realistic and responsible to expect changes in your application.
The front end could decide that want to list the breed and list when the pet first arrived. If I did not return all the information to
begin with, then I would need to change the contract. Changing the contract is a hassle and can be avoided.</p>
<p>To my second point in <strong>maintain structure</strong>, there was no custom <code>ListDogResponse</code> response class. I just returned all the
information the <code>Dog</code> class had to begin with. I've seen a lot of people implement this idea of an <code>opaqueClass</code> or <code>transparentClass</code>
which hides or shows data about your class. This confuses me because often the data I care about is missing.</p>
<p>in summary</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe it is necessary and important for the frontend to shape the data they deal with.</li>
<li>I don't believe in the backend needing to bend and make compromises and conveniences for the front end.</li>
<li>I believe transport <code>opaque</code> and <code>transparent</code> classes to be confusing and dishonest.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a broad and accurate transfer of data, the backend and frontend can treat the alike. This will make code paths and
execution behave more similarly across network requests.</p>

<p>(1) I'm ignoring any paging requirements for simplicity. Were a small animal shelter.</p>
